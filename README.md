# Customer-Personality-Analysis
Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.


The most important part of a customer personality analysis is getting the answers to questions such as:

# 1)What people say about your product: what gives customers’ attitude towards the product.
# 2)What people do: which reveals what people are doing rather than what they are saying about your product.
